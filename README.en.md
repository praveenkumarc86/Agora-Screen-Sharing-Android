# Agora Screen Sharing Android

*其他语言版本： [简体中文](README.md)*

The Agora Screen Sharing for Android Sample App is an open-source demo that shows how to enable screen sharing function using the Agora Video SDK.

With this sample app, you can:

- Start/Stop sharing screen

A tutorial demo for Agora Video SDK can be found here: [Agora-Android-Tutorial-1to1](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Android-Tutorial-1to1)

You can find demo for iOS here: [Agora-Screen-Sharing-iOS](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Agora-Screen-Sharing-iOS)

## Running the App
**First**, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID. Update "app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml" with your App ID.

```
<string name="agora_app_id"><#YOUR APP ID#></string>
```

**Next**, integrate the Agora Video SDK and there are two ways to integrate:

- The recommended way to integrate:

Add the address which can integrate the Agora Video SDK automatically through JCenter in the property of the dependence of the "app/build.gradle":
```
compile 'io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:2.0.0'
```
(This sample program has added this address and do not need to add again. Adding the link address is the most important step if you want to integrate the Agora Video SDK in your own application.)

- Alternative way to integrate:

First, download the **Agora Video SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/blog/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy ***.jar** under **libs** to **app/libs**, **arm64-v8a**/**x86**/**armeabi-v7a** under **libs** to **app/src/main/jniLibs**.
a
Then, add the fllowing code in the property of the dependence of the "app/build.gradle":

```
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
```

**Finally**, open project with Android Studio, connect your Android device, build and run.

Or use `Gradle` to build and run.

## Developer Environment Requirements
- Android Studio 2.0 or above
- Real devices (Nexus 5X or other devices)
- Some simulators are function missing or have performance issue, so real device is the best choice
